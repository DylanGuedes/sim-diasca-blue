% Class modeling a soda vending machine.
%
-module(class_SodaVendingMachine).


% Determines what are the mother classes of this class (if any):
-define( wooper_superclasses, [ class_Actor ] ).


% parameters taken by the constructor ('construct').
-define( wooper_construct_parameters, ActorSettings, MachineName,
		 InitialCanCount, CanCost ).


% Declaring all variations of WOOPER-defined standard life-cycle operations:
% (template pasted, just two replacements performed to update arities)
-define( wooper_construct_export, new/4, new_link/4,
		 synchronous_new/4, synchronous_new_link/4,
		 synchronous_timed_new/4, synchronous_timed_new_link/4,
		 remote_new/5, remote_new_link/5, remote_synchronous_new/5,
		 remote_synchronous_new_link/5, remote_synchronisable_new_link/5,
		 remote_synchronous_timed_new/5, remote_synchronous_timed_new_link/5,
		 construct/5, destruct/1 ).


% Method declarations.
-define( wooper_method_export, actSpontaneous/1, onFirstDiasca/2,
		 getCanCost/2, orderSoda/3 ).


% For common types defined in this Soda-Test example:
-include("soda_test_types.hrl").


% Allows to define WOOPER base variables and methods for that class:
-include("wooper.hrl").


% Must be included before class_TraceEmitter header:
-define( trace_emitter_categorization, "Soda-test.SodaVendingMachine" ).


% Allows to use macros for trace sending:
-include("sim_diasca_for_models.hrl").


% The class-specific attributes of a soda vending machine are:
%
% - can_count :: can_count() is the (positive integer) number of cans a machine
% currently holds
%
% - can_cost :: amount() is the cost of a can from this machine (as a
% floating-point sum, in euros)
%
% - probe_pid :: class_Probe:probe_pid() is the PID (if any) of the probe
% declared by this vending machine
