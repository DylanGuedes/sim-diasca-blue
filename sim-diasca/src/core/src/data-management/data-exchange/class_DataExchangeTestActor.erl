% Test of the data-logger facilities, from a simulation actor.
%
-module(class_DataExchangeTestActor).


% Determines what are the mother classes of this class (if any):
-define( wooper_superclasses, [ class_Actor ] ).



% Parameters taken by the constructor ('construct').
-define( wooper_construct_parameters, ActorSettings, ActorName, DataKey,
		 TerminationTickOffset ).



% Declaring all variations of WOOPER standard life-cycle operations:
% (template pasted, two replacements performed to update arities)
-define( wooper_construct_export, new/4, new_link/4,
		 synchronous_new/4, synchronous_new_link/4,
		 synchronous_timed_new/4, synchronous_timed_new_link/4,
		 remote_new/5, remote_new_link/5, remote_synchronous_new/5,
		 remote_synchronous_new_link/5, remote_synchronisable_new_link/5,
		 remote_synchronous_timed_new/5, remote_synchronous_timed_new_link/5,
		 construct/5, destruct/1 ).


% Member method declarations.
-define( wooper_method_export, actSpontaneous/1, onFirstDiasca/2 ).



% Allows to define WOOPER base variables and methods for that class:
-include("wooper.hrl").


% Must be included before class_TraceEmitter header:
-define( trace_emitter_categorization, "Actor.Test.DataExchange" ).


% Allows to use macros for trace sending:
-include("sim_diasca_for_models.hrl").




% Implementation notes:
%
% This test actor will perform data-exchanges (read/modify/write). The point is
% that it does not even to know whether the simulation is started or not (in
% this case it is an initial actor).



% Constructs a new test actor for data-logging:
%
% - ActorSettings corresponds to the engine settings for this actor, as
% determined by the load-balancer
%
% - ActorName the name of the actor
%
% - DataKey is an atom corresponding to the key of a data entry of interest for
% that actor
%
% - TerminationTickOffset the duration after which this actor should terminate
