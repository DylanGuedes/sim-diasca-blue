% Class modeling the failure behaviour of equipments according to a gaussian

%
% It is a less common failure model than the exponential one.
% See: class_ExponentialFailureModel.

-module(class_GaussianFailureModel).


% Determines what are the mother classes of this class (if any):
-define( wooper_superclasses, [ class_FailureModel ] ).


% Parameters taken by the constructor ('construct').
-define( wooper_construct_parameters, ActorSettings, MTTF, FailureVariance ).


% Declaring all variations of WOOPER-defined standard life-cycle operations:
% (template pasted, just two replacements performed to update arities)

-define( wooper_construct_export, new/3, new_link/3,
		 synchronous_new/3, synchronous_new_link/3,
		 synchronous_timed_new/3, synchronous_timed_new_link/3,
		 remote_new/4, remote_new_link/4, remote_synchronous_new/4,
		 remote_synchronous_new_link/4, remote_synchronisable_new_link/4,
		 remote_synchronous_timed_new/4, remote_synchronous_timed_new_link/4,
		 construct/4 ).


% Member method declarations.
-define(wooper_method_export,).



% Allows to define WOOPER base variables and methods for that class:
-include("wooper.hrl").


% Must be included before class_TraceEmitter header:
-define( trace_emitter_categorization,
		 "Actor.StochasticActor.FailureModel.GaussianFailureModel" ).


% Allows to use macros for trace sending:
-include("sim_diasca_for_models.hrl").



% Constructs a new gaussian failure model actor.
%
% MTTF is Mean Time To Failure, the mean (average) duration before a working
% system fails.
%
% All equipments using a given instance of this failure model will therefore
% have the same MTTF, but the shared random manager (thanks to the stochastic
% inheritance) will ensure each will act independently from the other
% equipments, according to the gaussian distribution.
%
% Note: a random manager must be running beforehand.

	MTTF = MTTFsecond + 60 * ( MTTFminute + 60 * ( MTTFhour + 24*MTTFday ) ),

	% Defines an exponential failure profile, for stochastic class to manage it:
