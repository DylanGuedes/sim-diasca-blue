% Class modeling the repair behaviour of equipments.
%
% Most repair models rely on underlying random generators.
%
% Their instances must be simulation actors, so that the total ordering of their
% incoming messages is recreated, otherwise the generation of the random numbers
% will break reproducibility.
%
% Thus a repair model is a stochastic actor.
% See equipment_integration_test.erl for an integration test.

-module(class_RepairModel).


% Determines what are the mother classes of this class (if any):
-define( wooper_superclasses, [ class_StochasticActor ] ).


% Parameters taken by the constructor ('construct').
-define( wooper_construct_parameters, ActorSettings, RepairModelName,
		 RandomProfile ).


% Declaring all variations of WOOPER-defined standard life-cycle operations:
% (template pasted, just two replacements performed to update arities)
-define( wooper_construct_export, new/3, new_link/3,
		 synchronous_new/3, synchronous_new_link/3,
		 synchronous_timed_new/3, synchronous_timed_new_link/3,
		 remote_new/4, remote_new_link/4, remote_synchronous_new/4,
		 remote_synchronous_new_link/4, remote_synchronisable_new_link/4,
		 remote_synchronous_timed_new/4, remote_synchronous_timed_new_link/4,
		 construct/4 ).


% Method declarations.
-define( wooper_method_export, onFirstDiasca/2, getNextRepair/2 ).


-type mttr() :: class_Equipment:reliability_duration().


-export_type([ mttr/0 ]).



% Allows to define WOOPER base variables and methods for that class:
-include("wooper.hrl").


% Must be included before class_TraceEmitter header:
-define( trace_emitter_categorization, "Actor.StochasticActor.RepairModel" ).


% Allows to use macros for trace sending:
-include("sim_diasca_for_models.hrl").



% Constructs a new repair model:
%
% - ActorSettings corresponds to the engine settings for this actor, as
% determined by the load-balancer
%
% - RepairModelName is its name
%
% - RandomProfile is a tuple describing the kind of randomness needed to compute
% reparation times (if any)
%
%
% RandomProfile can be among:
%
% - { uniform, N } for uniform laws (positive integer)
%
% - { exponential, Lambda } for exponential laws (floating-point)
%
% - { positive_integer_exponential, Lambda } for exponential laws (positive
% integer)
%
% - { gaussian, Mu, Sigma } for gaussian laws
%
% - { positive_integer_gaussian, Mu, Sigma } for gaussian laws (positive
% integer)
